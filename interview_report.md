# Interview report

### General city planner questions:

#### Where do you work?
- ecoptima (private city planning company in Bern)
- Mostly work for municipalities, but also for private land planning.
- As an assistant planner

#### Do you have any systems for getting in touch with the city residents?
- When working with municipalities, the involvement of residents is quite regulated (“Mitwirkung”).
- Citizens can participate (physically show up, or at the city webpage).  

#### How much influence does city residents have on the decisions made in your office?
- Feedback has to be answered - all of them! Citizens sometimes have crazy ideas.
- If there are many comments on the same topic, it needs to be considered in the planning.

#### To what degree is GIS (Geographic Information Systems) used in your office?
- Used ***a lot***

#### To what degree is your office monitoring air quality & green areas in the city?
- Certain % must stay green areas
- Only need to consider it when you plan areas with heavy industries

### Software’s usability:
- Agrees that GiS systems are a bit complicated to use and that a simpler program such as ours could have some benefits.

#### Usefulness: Do you feel a system like this could be of any use? 
- Going from pointwise measurements to a map would be very useful, especially to make information accessible for the public (City planners already used to interpreting point measurements)

#### Novelty: Do you feel like this brings any new information compared to software that already exists?
- Don’t know if anything similar exists. Hasn’t seen it in his work

#### Fidelity: Is the system capturing the real world problem accurately? What features could be changed/added to fit the real problem better?
- There's many more variables you can take into account, but that as a start the ones we have are good. Greenspaces are good and nice to work with so thinks it's a reasonable focus. 

### Software’s reasoning:
- Provided inputs on possible recommendations we can give to improve air quality. Such as lowering speed limits to decrease air pollution. 

#### Membership functions: What do you think of the membership functions used in the software? How could the membership functions be improved?
- Provided sources for scales used officially in Switzerland
- [Maps of Switzerland](https://map.geo.admin.ch/#/map?lang=en&center=2660000,1190000&z=1&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&topic=ech&layers=ch.bfs.volkszaehlung-bevoelkerungsstatistik_einwohner@year=2023)

#### Fuzzy rules: What do you think of the rules in the fuzzy system? What rules could be changed/added to make a better assessment?
- Approved of the rules as reasonable
- Added that there are many more factors that could be considered as input variables, such as proximity of traffic, industry, etc.
